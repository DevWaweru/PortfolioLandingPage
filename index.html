                    The resort project was a stepping stone that helped to understand how to put a menu in the top. 
                    This project was created from the practice on Wednesday, where we were instructed to create a mock website 
                    for a resort with at least 2 or more designs. We would then call the TA to choose the best design. The purpose 
                    was to illustrate how to use branches, and the gh-pages as well.
                    After numerous attempts, I was able to get the menu to appear horizontally and vertically as well.
                    However, the horizontal menu style is what appears best according to the TA.

                    This project is the recent one before commencing the Friday's Independent Project. The project was created on Thursday,
                    and has been used to illustrate the understanding of styling with box models, divs and spans, floats, classes and Ids.
                    Through this project, I was also able to get the menu to become fixed to the top.
