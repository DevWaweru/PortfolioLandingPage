#### By **Richard Waweru**
## Description
The Portfolio Landing Page is a simple website meant to illustrate if the basics of css and HTML are understood from the first week of training at Moringa Prep. The website has a fixed navigation bar, with a picture of a hot cup of latte. The picture displays elegance, while maintaining the 
impression of how one needs the coffee.
